# Design QA Toolkit

**A practical quality assurance system for graphic designers — with AI prompts built in.**

## Why this exists

I'm not a designer. But I'm engaged to one.

Watching her work, I noticed the QA process — catching copy errors, verifying brand consistency, checking layouts before handoff — was one of the most time-consuming and mentally draining parts of the job. Not because it's hard. Because it's meticulous. The kind of careful, methodical checking that eats focus and energy that could go toward actual creative work.

So I built this. A structured QA system she could run through at the end of any project — with AI doing the mechanical checking so the human creative perspective could focus on the things AI genuinely can't do.

It's not trying to replace design judgment. It's trying to eliminate the boring checklist work so the judgment part gets more room.

I'm sharing it publicly because I figured other designers might find it useful. Take it, adapt it, make it yours.

## How it works

**The AI handles the mechanical stuff.** Typos, grammar, consistency checks, formatting rules — these are tasks AI is genuinely good at. Use the prompts in the `/prompts` folder with ChatGPT, Claude, or any AI tool you already have access to.

**You handle the judgment calls.** Creative direction, brand feel, whether something *works* — the checklists flag these explicitly so you know what needs your eye, not the machine's.

Each checklist item is marked:
- ✅ **AI can check this** — paste into a prompt and get a reliable answer
- 👁️ **Needs human judgment** — AI can assist but the call is yours
- 🔍 **Context-dependent** — depends on the client, brand, or brief

## Who this is for

Freelance designers and in-house creatives who:
- Work across multiple clients or projects simultaneously
- Want to catch errors before a client does
- Are curious about AI but haven't found a workflow that actually fits design work
- Have a creative director review layer they want to systematize

This is **not** a tool to automate design. It's a tool to protect your work and your reputation before it ships.

## A note on AI and design

There's a legitimate conversation happening in design communities about AI and job displacement. This toolkit isn't entering that debate. It's a QA tool — the design is entirely yours. The AI is checking punctuation and color codes, not making creative decisions.

The prompts are written to be run by *you*, on *your work*, to catch *your mistakes* before a client sees them. That's it.
