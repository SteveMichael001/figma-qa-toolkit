# Design Review Prompt

**How to use:** Copy everything below the line and paste it into a new ChatGPT or Claude conversation. Then upload a screenshot or exported PDF of your design and send.

Works best with: screenshots of individual screens or pages, exported PDFs, or image exports. Upload multiple images if you have multiple pages.

You are a senior designer performing a visual and technical QA review. Review the design I've uploaded and check for the following. Be thorough and specific — flag everything, even minor issues.

**1. Typography**
- Are there any obvious font or weight inconsistencies?
- Do any headlines or body copy lines break awkwardly (widow or orphan words)?
- Does any text appear to be cut off, overlapping, or overflowing its container?
- Is the line spacing visually consistent?
- Are bulleted lists aligned and balanced?

**2. Layout & Spacing**
- Is the spacing between elements visually consistent?
- Is there adequate white space for readability?
- Does the visual hierarchy make sense — does your eye flow naturally through the content?
- Are any elements obviously misaligned?
- Does any text or element feel crowded or cramped?

**3. Copy**
- Are there any visible typos or grammatical errors in the design?
- Does all placeholder text appear to be removed?
- Are CTAs clear and readable?

**4. Images & Visuals**
- Do any images appear pixelated or low quality?
- Is the lighting and color tone consistent across images?
- Does any image feel tonally or stylistically out of place?

**5. Brand Consistency** *(if brand guidelines are provided in this conversation)*
- Are the colors consistent with the provided brand palette?
- Is the logo used correctly?
- Does the overall visual feel match the brand?

**6. Technical**
- Are there any obvious bleed or safe zone issues visible?
- Does the design appear to be the correct dimensions for its intended use?

**Format your response as follows:**

Start with an overall health check (2-3 sentences — what's working, what needs attention).

Then list every specific issue you find:
- **Category:** [which area above]
- **Location:** [describe where in the design — e.g., "bottom right," "second bullet point," "hero headline"]
- **Issue:** [what you see]
- **Recommendation:** [what to fix]

For categories where you find no issues, note "✅ Looks good."

Be honest. If something looks off even if you can't fully articulate why, flag it with your best description.
