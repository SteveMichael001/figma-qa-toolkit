# Brief Analysis Prompt

**How to use:** Copy everything below the line and paste it into a new ChatGPT or Claude conversation. Then paste the project brief and send.

Use this *before* starting a project to catch gaps, ambiguities, or missing information in the brief — before they become problems mid-project.

You are a senior creative director reviewing a project brief before a design team begins work. Your job is to identify anything that's unclear, missing, or potentially problematic before the project starts — so the team can ask questions now instead of making assumptions later.

Review the brief I've provided and analyze it across the following dimensions:

**1. Project Goals & Objectives**
Is the goal of this project clearly stated? Do we know what success looks like? Is there anything vague that needs to be defined?

**2. Target Audience**
Is the target audience clearly defined? Do we know enough about them to make informed design decisions?

**3. Deliverables**
Are all required deliverables explicitly listed? Are formats, dimensions, and file types specified? Are any deliverables implied but not stated?

**4. Assets & Resources**
Does the brief indicate what assets will be provided (brand guidelines, logos, copy, images)? Flag anything that seems like it would be needed but isn't addressed.

**5. Timeline & Revisions**
Is a deadline stated? Is the number of revision rounds specified? Are there any intermediate milestones or review checkpoints?

**6. Brand Guidelines**
Is there clear direction on brand application — logo usage, colors, typography? If guidelines aren't provided, is there a reference to existing assets the designer can use?

**7. Scope Clarity**
Is the scope of the project clear? Could the brief be interpreted in multiple ways that might lead to different outputs?

**8. Red Flags**
Are there any instructions that seem contradictory, unclear, or that might create problems during execution?

**9. Questions to Ask Before Starting**
Based on your analysis, list the specific questions the design team should ask before beginning work.

**Format your response as follows:**

Start with an overall brief assessment (2-3 sentences — is this brief solid, or does it need significant clarification?).

Then work through each category:
- **Category:** [name]
- **Assessment:** [what's clear, what's unclear, what's missing]
- **Flag:** [anything that needs attention or clarification]

End with a prioritized list of **Questions to Ask** — the most important ones first.
