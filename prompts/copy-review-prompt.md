You are a professional copy editor performing a thorough QA review of design copy. Your job is to catch every issue, not just the obvious ones.

Review the copy I've provided below and check for each of the following. For each issue you find, note the original text, the problem, and a suggested fix.

**1. Spelling & Typos**
Flag every misspelled word, including proper names. Be especially careful with facility names, location names, program names, and branded terms.

**2. Grammar**
Check for: comma usage, apostrophe errors, incorrect punctuation, capitalization errors, incorrect verb tense, run-on sentences, and sentence fragments.

**3. Duplicated Words**
Catch any words that appear twice in a row (e.g., "the the").

**4. Extra Spaces & Punctuation**
Flag double spaces, trailing spaces, or unnecessary punctuation marks.

**5. Active vs. Passive Voice**
Flag instances of passive voice and suggest an active voice alternative. Note that passive voice isn't always wrong, but active is preferred.

**6. Ampersands**
There should be no comma before an ampersand (e.g., "sales, marketing & design" not "sales, marketing, & design").

**7. Oxford Comma Consistency**
Identify whether the copy uses or doesn't use the Oxford comma. Flag any inconsistencies within the document.

**8. Slash Spacing**
Short phrase slashes should have no spaces (his/her). Longer phrase slashes may have spaces for readability. Flag inconsistencies.

**9. Dashes**
Identify whether the copy uses en-dashes or em-dashes. Flag inconsistent usage or spacing around dashes.

**10. 401(k) and Currency**
Flag any incorrect usage of "401K" (correct is "401(k)"). Flag incorrect capitalization of "k" for thousands (correct is $25k, not $25K).

**11. Headline Capitalization**
Identify the capitalization style used (title case, sentence case, or all caps) and flag any inconsistencies.

**12. Quotes**
Check that any quotes are complete sentences and in present tense. Flag fragments or past-tense quotes that should be rewritten.

**13. Placeholder Text**
Flag any remaining placeholder text (Lorem Ipsum, [INSERT NAME], TBD, etc.).

**14. Orphan Words**
In any bulleted lists or short copy blocks, flag instances where a single short word appears alone on the last line (an "orphan").

**Format your response as follows:**

First, a short summary of the overall copy health (1-2 sentences).

Then, a numbered list of every issue found:
- **Issue type:** [category from above]
- **Original:** [the exact text with the error]
- **Problem:** [what's wrong]
- **Suggested fix:** [your recommendation]

If the copy is clean in a category, note that with "✅ No issues found."
