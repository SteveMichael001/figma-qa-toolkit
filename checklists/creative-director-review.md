- 🔍 Specs are complete — dimensions, formats, deliverable count
- 🔍 Vendor templates provided if applicable
- 🔍 Brand guidelines and logos provided
- 👁️ The story being told is clear — what is the client trying to communicate?
- 👁️ Special requests and restrictions are called out explicitly
- 🔍 Context for where the deliverable will live — print placement, digital ad placement, etc. — this tells you how people will interact with it
- 🔍 Image sourcing plan — stock, client-provided, pulled from their social assets
- 👁️ Clear feedback deliverable defined — what does approval look like?
- 👁️ Clear final deliverable defined — link, PPT, file share, live in dev, etc.
- 🔍 Revision rounds specified
