# Copy QA Checklist

Use this checklist to review copy before it goes into design or before client delivery.

**Legend:**
- ✅ AI can check this reliably — use the copy review prompt
- 👁️ Needs human judgment
- 🔍 Context-dependent — check against the brand guide or previous assets

---

## Spelling & Grammar

- ✅ No typos — double-check spelling on all proper names, locations, programs, facilities
- ✅ No grammar errors — comma usage, apostrophes, punctuation, capitalization, verb tense, run-on sentences
- ✅ No duplicated words
- ✅ No extra spaces or unnecessary punctuation
- ✅ Active voice used where possible *(passive is okay occasionally, but active is preferred)*

---

## Punctuation & Formatting Rules

- ✅ No comma before an ampersand *(e.g., "Me, myself & I" — not "Me, myself, & I")*
- ✅ No Oxford comma inconsistencies — check usage against brand guide and keep it consistent throughout
- ✅ No spaces between slashes and words for short phrases *(his/her — not his / her)*
- ✅ En-dash and em-dash usage is consistent — check brand guide or existing assets for their preference
- ✅ 401(k) is written correctly *(NOT 401K)*
- ✅ Lowercase "k" for thousands *(e.g., $25k — not $25K)*
- 🔍 Headlines and subheads are capitalized correctly and consistently *(title case vs. sentence case vs. all caps — follow their brand standard)*

---

## Brand Voice & Messaging

- 🔍 Copy is consistent with brand messaging, brand guide, and tone of voice
- 👁️ Messaging is concise, clear, and on-brand
- 👁️ Headlines and subheads are attention-grabbing and relevant
- 👁️ CTA is strong, action-oriented, and aligned with the project goal
- 👁️ Copy is scannable — uses hierarchy, bullets, short paragraphs

---

## Quotes & Attribution

- ✅ Quotes are complete sentences and in present tense *(rewrite if pulled from Glassdoor or similar sources where they're fragments)*
- ✅ Quote attribution follows consistent order and casing throughout

---

## Role Titles & Terminology

- ✅ Role titles are capitalized consistently if the brand capitalizes them
- ✅ Consistent terminology and voice across all content

---

## CTAs & Links

- ✅ All CTAs are clear — include a note indicating where each CTA links
- 🔍 Bullet point sections use punctuation consistently — either all bullets end with periods or none do
- 🔍 Footer copy is complete — all links, privacy policies, and legal copy accounted for

---

## Compliance & Completeness

- 👁️ Copy complies with any legal or disclaimer requirements
- ✅ Copy follows character count limitations if required *(Meta, LinkedIn, Google, etc.)*
- ✅ All placeholder text has been removed or replaced
- 👁️ **Every part of the brief has been addressed**

---

## Checking Copy in Design

Once copy is placed in the design file, verify:

- ✅ Headers applied as intended
- ✅ Body copy applied as intended
- ✅ Bullet points applied in the correct order
- ✅ Copy appears in the correct order in the design
- ✅ Taglines and callouts applied as intended
- ✅ CTAs applied as intended
- 👁️ Bolding makes sense from both a copy and design perspective
- 👁️ No orphans or widows — especially in headlines. If a headline breaks awkwardly, suggest a revision that works better visually
